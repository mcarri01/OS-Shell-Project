Description
    
    This manual outlines the various commands that this shell supports and its usage.

Usage

    Here are the following commands supported by the shell, along with their invocation and usage.

        cd <directory> : This command changes the current directory to the one specificed in the <directory> argument. If no 
        argument is present, simply reports the current directory. When invoking this command the PWD environment variable 
        changes.

        clr : Clears the screen

        dir <directory> Lists the contents of the directory specificed by the <directory> argument. If no argument is present, 
        simply lists contents of the current directory. 

        environ: Lists all the environment strings of the shell. 

        echo <comment> : Displays <comment> and then prints a newline.

        help : Invoke this user manual

        pause  : Pauses operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.

        quit : Waits for all child processes to finish and then exits the shell. User may also use 'Cntrl-D' to end their 
        session. 

    The shell also supports standard program invocation by passing a proper path to the executable. 

    For example:

        ./<exec> to run executable in local directory or

        path/to/exec to run executable to any arbitrary executable path

        To run any of the above commands or external programs in background, append '&' to the end of the command, the shell 
        will launch a child process to execute the program and return to reading the next interactive/batch input. Terminiated 
        background task will alert the shell via signal handler and a prompt with terminated child's PID will be shown on the 
        next input iteration of shell.

    In addition, the shell supports I/O redirection with the use of the '>' and '>>' arguments. 
    
        '>' creates new file if one does not exist or replaces existing content within the specified file

        '>>' creates new file if one does not exist or appends content to specificed file.
